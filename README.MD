# Traffic Crashes Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing a **Traffic Crashes dataset** to understand patterns, trends, and factors contributing to road accidents.

The goal of this analysis is to practice **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization** using real-world traffic data.

## 📂 Dataset
*Traffic Crashes dataset* (Kaggle)

## 🔧 Liabraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🔍 What This Project Includes
- Loading and inspecting the dataset
- Handling Inconsistent values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzing crash trends based on:
  - Time (year, month, day, hour)
  - Location-related features
  - Crash severity and contributing factors
- Visualizing patterns and distributions

## 📊 Key Insights
- Identified trends in traffic crashes over time
- Observed patterns related to crash frequency and severity
- Highlighted factors that may contribute to higher accident rates

## 📊 Skills Practiced
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualization
- Working with large, real-world datasets
- Interpreting patterns from traffic data
